        <p>
            An old man is just an old man.  </br>
            With wood, nails, and an axe,  </br>
            Spring, summer, autumn, winter… year after year,</br>
            The old man's life slips away;  </br>
        </br>
            The hunger and toil, like that of oxen and horses</br>
            Seem never to have taught him how to express himself.  </br>
            Sometimes you might see him smoking a dry pipe,  </br>
            Silently lost in thought, facing the dark corner of the room.</br>
        </br>
            Is he feeling sorrow? But who  </br>
            Could know? Perhaps this is the old man's most peaceful moment—</br>
            Watching the wisping blue smoke rise and drift away.
